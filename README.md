Multiplayer networked drawing game.
Players take take turns drawing and guessing what other players have drawn. Each turn, one player is presented with a word to draw.
Other players can see what the player is drawing and have to guess which word the picture represents.
Guessing correctly gives both the player drawing and the player guessing some points.
